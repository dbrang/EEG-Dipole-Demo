# EEG-Dipole-Demo
A lightweight, interactive web-based tool designed to build an intuitive understanding of EEG forward modeling. This simulation visualizes how a neural source (modeled as a current dipole) generates electrical potentials across the scalp, bridging the gap between underlying brain activity and the waveforms seen on an EEG monitor.
